I am a Ph.D. student at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in the [Division of Robotics, Perception and Learning (RPL)](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl)  in Stockholm, under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof. Mårten Björkman](https://www.kth.se/profile/celle) and co-supervision of [Asst. Prof. Kathlén Kohn](https://kathlenkohn.github.io) and [Prof. Danica Kragic](https://www.kth.se/profile/dani). 
My primary research interest is in the area of neural representation and rendering of dynamic scenes.

My Ph.D. position is funded by the grant [3D Scene Perception, Embeddings and Neural Rendering](https://neural3d.github.io) from the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org). 
For this reason, you can also meet me at courses of the WASP Graduate School.
